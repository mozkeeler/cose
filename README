verify-signature
================
verify-signature is a utility library to verify public-key signatures over arbitrary data. The
underlying implementation is NSS, so it is probably most useful if your application or library is
already using NSS. In particular, this library makes no effort to ensure that NSS has been
initialized (or that it won't be shut down) prior to using it, meaning that consumers of this
library must enforce this.
