verify-signed-digest
====================
verify-signed-digest is a wrapper around the NSS function VFY_VerifyDigestDirect. It is probably
most useful if your application or library is already using NSS. In particular, this library makes
no effort to ensure that NSS has been initialized (or that it won't be shut down) prior to calling
VFY_VerifyDigestDirect, meaning that consumers of this library must enforce this.
